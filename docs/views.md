# Views

## Layout View

To extend the layout view, you can use the `aura::components.layout.app` layout.
To copy the layout app file to your project, run:
`cp vendor/eminiarts/aura/resources/views/components/layout/app.blade.php resources/views/vendor/aura/components/layout/app.blade.php`

This command will copy only the `app.blade.php` layout file from the Aura CMS vendor folder to your project's `resources/views/vendor/aura/components/layout` directory, allowing you to customize it as needed.
