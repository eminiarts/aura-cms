# Views

## Layout View

Aura CMS provides a default layout view that you can extend and customize for your application. To use the default layout, you can extend it in your Blade templates like this:

`php artisan aura:layout`

This command will copy only the `app.blade.php` layout file from the Aura CMS vendor folder to your project's `resources/views/vendor/aura/components/layout` directory, allowing you to customize it as needed.
