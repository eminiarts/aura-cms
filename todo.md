# Aura CMS Documentation Improvement Plan

## Introduction

Aura CMS is a powerful, modern content management system built on the TALL stack (Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, Laravel, and Livewire) that provides Laravel developers with a flexible framework for building custom applications. However, the current documentation needs significant improvements to better serve the Laravel developer community.

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to enhance the Aura CMS documentation, making it more complete, practical, and developer-friendly. The improvements will focus on providing real-world examples, explaining advanced features, and ensuring Laravel developers can quickly understand and leverage Aura CMS's full potential.

## 📋 AI Assistant Workflow Instructions

When working on any documentation phase/chapter (e.g., "work on phase 1.1"), follow these steps:

### 1. 📖 Review Current Documentation
- Read the existing documentation file for the chapter
- Identify gaps, outdated information, and areas needing clarification
- Note the overall structure and flow

### 2. 🔍 Explore the Codebase
- Examine relevant source code files in `src/` directory
- Study specific implementations (classes, traits, methods)
- Look at code examples in the codebase
- Pay special attention to:
  - Base classes and their properties/methods
  - Traits and their usage patterns
  - Configuration options
  - Event hooks and listeners

### 3. 🧪 Analyze Tests
- List all tests related to the feature/chapter
- Read test files based on their descriptive names
- Extract usage examples from tests
- Note edge cases and validation rules
- Use tests to understand expected behavior

### 4. ✍️ Improve Documentation
- Write for Laravel developers (assume Laravel knowledge)
- Add practical, real-world examples
- Include code snippets from actual implementations
- Document all options, methods, and properties
- Add "Pro Tips" for advanced usage
- Include "Common Pitfalls" warnings
- Structure content logically with clear headings

### 5. 🎥 Video Placeholders
- When visual demonstration would be helpful, add:
  ```
  > 📹 **Video Placeholder**: [Description of what the video should show]
  ```
- Be specific about what should be demonstrated

### 6. ✅ Request Review
- Complete only the assigned chapter
- Ask: "I've completed the [Chapter Name] documentation. Please review and let me know if any refinements are needed."
- Wait for feedback before proceeding

### 7. 🔄 Final Review
- After approval, review the chapter in context
- Check previous and next chapters for:
  - Unnecessary duplication
  - Inconsistent terminology
  - Missing cross-references
- Ensure smooth flow between chapters

### Important Notes:
- **Focus**: Work only on the specified chapter/phase
- **Audience**: Laravel developers with framework knowledge
- **Style**: Clear, concise, technical but approachable
- **Examples**: Use real code from the Aura CMS codebase
- **Testing**: All code examples should be derived from working code
